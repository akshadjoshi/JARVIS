This repo explains and is there to help when the exploits for python2 `impacket` mess up with the python3 `impacket`. So this is the solution for it which will not only help you run python2 impacket but also isolate it from the main env.

# Steps

## Step 1
Install the latest anaconda from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download):
and install the script via:
```
bash Anaconda3-2023.09-0-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
It will ask for a prompt with other prompts which says:
Do you want to activate `conda` when you start with terminal , say yes
## Step 2:
Setup the environment  with python2:
```
conda create -n <env-name> python=2.7
```
we can list the env with:
```
conda env list
```
and activate with:
```
conda activate <env-name>
```
we can terminate it via:
```
conda deactivate
```

## Step 3:
Installing impacket:
So we *Do Not install latest impacket* but:
```
pip install impacket==0.9.15
```

```
pip2 install pycryptodomex
```


```
pip2.7 install pycrypto
```
or
```
easy_install install pycrypto
```

```
pip2.7 install pyasn1
```
## python 3.10

```
conda create -n py310 python=3.10
conda activate py310
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



Then we are ready to run the codes that require python2 or impacket for python2
